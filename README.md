# IBM-NJ-USER-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
Project Overview
The User Authentication System is a secure web-based application designed to verify and
manage user identities through login and registration processes.
Authentication plays a vital role in any web application where users access personal or
restricted information.
This system ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources, while all
sensitive information—such as passwords—is safely stored and transmitted.
The project implements modern authentication mechanisms using password hashing and
token-based authentication (JWT) to provide a secure and scalable solution.
2. Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:
1. To develop a secure and reliable user authentication system.
2. To ensure safe user data storage using encryption and hashing.
3. To authenticate users through token-based login sessions.
4. To create a simple and responsive interface for user interaction.
5. To understand and implement backend security principles used in real-world
applications.
3. Scope of the Project
The system can be used by any web application that requires user login and registration
features.
It can be integrated into e-commerce platforms, social networking sites, or enterprise-level
systems for managing access control.
This project demonstrates core backend and frontend integration for secure data exchange.
4. Key Features
1. User Registration – Allows new users to create accounts with email and password.
2. Secure Login – Authenticates registered users before granting access.
3. Password Hashing – Converts plain passwords into hashed form for secure storage
using bcrypt.
4. JWT Authentication – Generates JSON Web Tokens for session management.
5. Form Validation – Ensures input correctness and data integrity.
6. Access Control – Restricts protected pages from unauthorized users.
7. Logout Functionality – Ends user sessions and clears tokens.
5. Technologies Used
Layer Technology/Tool Purpose
Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript For UI design and form handling
Backend Node.js, Express.js For server-side logic and API endpoints
Database MongoDB Atlas For storing user details securely
Authentication JWT, bcrypt For token generation and password hashing
Testing Postman For testing API endpoints
Deployment Render / Vercel / Netlify For hosting the web app
6. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture.
The frontend collects data and sends it to the backend server through HTTP API requests.
The backend verifies the data, interacts with the database, and returns a suitable response.
If authentication is successful, a JWT token is created and returned to the frontend to
maintain the user session.
